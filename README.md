# Adventure Works Report

## Summary

In this course project, I take on the role of a business intelligence analyst for Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company, and create an interactive dashboard from scratch. First, I connect and transform the raw data, which consists of several raw CSV files. Then I build a relational data model and add calculated fields with DAX formulas. Lastly, I create an interactive dashboard that includes multiple report pages.
